## **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The microbiome was the most interesting topic covered in my domain. It's surprising how the microbiome can be extremely different person to person and that it changes throughout the day. Furthermore, there's still more research that is needed to be done before we can fully understand it.

## **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
A possible investigation is studying the impact of chemicals known for their skincare benefits on the skin microbiome. One way to do this is by applying new techniques to study and recognize patterns across the skin microbiome, such as by building a transformer model or another neural network. Additionally, this would build on what I have learned over the course of this quarter since I am currently learning how to develop models using Pytorch.

## **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A potential change is using a chromosome that is not from Arabidopsis Thaliana to test the model. By using DNA from another species, we can further confirm that our model can make accurate predictions regardless of the DNA used. Thus, we can also study the patterns and motifs found in the DNA of species other than Arabidopsis Thaliana.

## **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would be interested in using the Pytorch library more since it is still new to me and I would like more experience with it. It would also be interesting if I can find a way to take advantage of my web development skills.
